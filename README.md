# The James Webb Space Telescope has observed an alien planet "death plunge" into its host star, 
revealing a dramatic end to its life. Instead of the star expanding and swallowing the planet, the planet's orbit decayed, causing it to spiral inward and collide with the star's atmosphere. This event caused a dramatic disturbance, with the star expelling gas and dust into space, as observed by Webb. 
James Webb Space Telescope documents alien planet's death ...
Here's a more detailed explanation:
Initial Observation:
In 2020, astronomers initially believed the planet was engulfed by its star as it expanded into a red giant, according to Prothom Alo. 
Webb's Post-Mortem:
Webb's observations provided a closer look at the aftermath, revealing a different scenario. 
Planetary Decay:
The planet's orbit gradually decayed due to gravitational interactions with the star, causing it to spiral inward. 
Catastrophic Collision:
The planet collided with the star's atmosphere, stripping away its outer layers and expelling stellar gas and dust. 
Evidence of the Aftermath:
Webb detected hot gas forming a ring around the star and an expanding cloud of cooler dust, which confirmed the event's intensity. 
Implications:
This observation suggests that planets may more commonly meet their fate by spiraling inward rather than being engulfed by their host star during the red giant phase, according to India Today.
